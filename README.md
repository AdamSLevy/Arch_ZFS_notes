# Arch Linux and ZFS Notes

This repo contains my notes for installing Arch Linux in two different ways using Virtual Box.

- `install.md` describes a basic install on a BIOS system.
- `install_zfs_root.md` describes how to install Arch Linux on a ZFS root filesystem using UEFI
firmware.

I made these notes for my own reference and I hope they can help you too.

## Disclaimer
These notes are ***not*** meant to serve as a complete how to guide to ZFS or Arch Linux. 

These are notes and tips that are meant to supplement the 
[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and 
[Forum](https://bbs.archlinux.org/). 
Do ***not*** blindly follow these instructions. Both for the safety of your system
and in accordance with 
[The Arch Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles), 
if you don't understand what a step does I highly recommend that you stop and go look it up.
